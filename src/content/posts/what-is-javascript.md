## JavaScript, In Short
JavaScript is the programming language of the web and has reached the height of worldwide popularity.

In 1995, Brendan Eich invented JavaScript as a way to bring web pages to life. The language provides levels of interactivity and behavior to the end user experience. The Netscape Navigator browser was the first to receive programmatic JavaScript capabilities. It was in 1996 when Eich and Netscape delivered JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization. TC39 (a technical committee) was formed to develop the language for Netscape 2 and JavaScript became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997.

JavaScript programs (namely, *scripts*) can be written directly within a HTML pages, where they run at page load. They are implemented and executed as plain text and need no particular preparation or compilation to run.

## History of JavaScript
At its inception, JavaScript bore another name: "LiveScript". At this juncture, it underwent the famed and politically-charged transformation, morphing into the name we know today. You see, Sun Microsystems's Java was experiencing major popularity at this time. It was then decided, for better or worse, that positioning this new language as a "younger brother" of Java would increase its proliferation.

As JavaScript became an entity all its own, the language grew from its cult-like, nominal roots and embraced a unique specification called ECMAScript. Today, JavaScript had no relation to Java whatsoever.

## JavaScript Versions
The tale of JavaScript bridges many versions. Throughout that story, it was gradually adopted by various browsers. The language became increasingly more mature as time passed and was eventually adopted by each of the now relevant browsers.

Here's the life of JavaScript over the ages:

## Executing JavaScript
JavaScript can be run inside a browser. However, the language takes another form; NodeJS, whereby it can be run server-side or on any JavaScript_engine_wielding device.

Browser-embedded JavaScript engines, or JavaScript Virtual Machines, effectively parse the script, compiles the script to machine code, and runs the product of such compilation. These engines take on numerous monikers, respective of the browsing environment in which they live.

V8 is used in Chrome, Opera, and Edge. SpiderMonkey is Firefox's engine. JavaScriptCore, Nitro, and SquirrelFish are leveraged in Safari. In Internet Explorer, Chakra is responsible for executing JavaScript code.
